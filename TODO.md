# TODOs:
	- make simple script that invokes `convert` and combines frames into an `.gif`

	- Maybe use TCLAP::UnlabeledValueArg simulate command
 	- Add constexpr where applicable
	- Add more meaningful error messages when parsing incorrect data
	- Add option for RequiredPositive... to report where it was thrown
