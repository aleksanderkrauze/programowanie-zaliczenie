# TODOs:
	- Solve problem of program slowing down and getting killed after ~600 frames

	- Maybe use TCLAP::UnlabeledValueArg simulate command
 	- Add constexpr where applicable
	- Add more meaningful error messages when parsing incorrect data
	- Add option for RequiredPositive... to report where it was thrown
